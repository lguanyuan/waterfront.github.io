<h1>Woodlands Waterfront Park</h1>
<img src="entrance.jpg" title="Woodlands Waterfront Park" alt="waterfront park" > <br>
<p id="AA" > Woodlands Waterfront Park is a park located at Admiralty Road West in Singapore and overlooks the sea from the north. Is is officially opened in January 2011.
 The theme of this park is Active and Healthy Community Lifestyle. It is considerably spacious with an area of approximately 10-hectares. featuring a 1.5KM long waterfront promenade, 400 meters jetty (along with a seafood restaurant at the mid-section of the jetty) and a multi-generation playground. The 6-hactares of undulating terrain within the coastal park also appeals to jogging and rollerskating enthusiasts.
Behind the carpark area and West of the entrance is Picnic Green, which is an open field kept shady by the surrounding trees. This is the spot specifically designed for you to set up your picnic as it is not as hilly compared to other areas of the park. You will not find many people on this side of the park as most of the crowd would divert to either the jetty or the playground.. </p><hr>

 right on the jetty and it is a full Halal restaurant. <br> 2.The opening hours are on Sundays to Thursdays: 2 pm till midnight, Fridays and Saturdays: 3 pm till 1 am. <br>

 <p> Straight ahead from the entrance of Woodlands Waterfront is the Central Spine Event Plaza, a two story complex outfitted with toilets, water coolers and vending machines. This is also one of the largest shelter around the park to seek refuge should it start to rain.
 It can also be an ideal place for a small scale event like a birthday celebration or just a simple gathering point for less than 20 pax. <hr>

 <p> Kites flying is a favourite activity at the park as there are no trees to enshare your precious kites if you stay away from the fringe of the sloping opened area and the costal 
 breeze is also a plus point. <hr>
